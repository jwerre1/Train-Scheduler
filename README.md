This project allows the user to enter information for a train, including its name, destination, the first time it arrives, and its frequency. Once submitted, this information appears within a table on the screen, and the next train is calculated, as well as the minutes until from the next train.

This information is stored on a database, meaning it can referenced even after refreshing the page, closing the browser, or opening the page on another device.
